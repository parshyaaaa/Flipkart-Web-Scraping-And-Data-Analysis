 Flipkart-Web-Scraping-And-Data-Analysis description.

 The Flipkart Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project is about collecting product information from Flipkart’s website and analyzing it to find useful patterns. Flipkart is one of India’s biggest online shopping platforms, so studying its data helps understand trends in pricing, reviews, and popular products.

 This project is a simple yet powerful way to understand trends in Flipkart’s online marketplace and use that knowledge for better decision-making.
